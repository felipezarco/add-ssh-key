# How to Generate SSH Key and Add it to Github (step by step)

1. Generate ssh key *with your own email*.
```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "felipezarco@hotmail.com"
``` 

2. Press Enter when
(/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_ed25519): **[Press enter]**

3. Leave it empty for no password OR choose your password (not very hard since you will need it everytime) 

4. Check if command below correctly outputs "Agent pid" with some number

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
``` 

5. Set the password to your private key (Optional on Windows)

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
``` 

6. Copy the generated SSH key:
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

7. Go to Github profile menu > *Settings* > *SSH and GPG keys* (or just [click here](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)), give it a name to identify the computer and paste it!

8. Do not forget to hit the ‚≠ê button if this worked üòâ !

That's it!
